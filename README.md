# My-Python-Projects
Source code of programs created using Python

There are two short Python codes in here.

One is a random dice roll, which when executes generates randomly a number between 1-6.

The second is a Twitter Sentimental Analysis, which takes a text input and then extracts data from Twitter to analyse what are the views of the users about that particular topic.
